TODO:
- začít

Basic game idea in rough state:
- player "lives" a live of a human being with focus on getting knowledge
- on reset, small portion of knowledge ("DNA") is transfered into new being

Other ideas:
- human being is getting older so progress gets inevitably slow and more expensive (diseases) until reset
- there are different types of human beings on reset, like farmer, banker, teacher, worker etc. with its own knowledge tree
- depending on one's knowledge, life of worker can be as shallow as working all life in factory or more exciting like to reach factory's management level
- getting knowledge in one area helps in other
- for example, farmer can get better prices, if there is some knowledge from banker in DNA
- on reset, there is a possibility to reborn into better family or even to continue in next generation of same family
